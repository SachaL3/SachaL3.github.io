## QMUL HTML & CSS Website ##

<u>What I have learnt over the past week:</u>

<b>Monday 13th June to Friday 17th June 2016</b>

<i>Acknowledgements: Thank you to Founders & Coders for their help in teaching us these skills. And QMUL for organising this event for SEMS students.</i>

<b>Languages: Git & Markdown (limited)
Display/Coding: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API</b>

Added a comments section, however I would like to display users' comments on the site itself. I believe this requires a .php file to store and process the comments

Note: Rotating images affect footer display ~ currently working out why.

I have added a footer with a moving element using CSS, there is also the marquee tag that allows messages to pass like a bulletin, however this removes certain effects such as text-shadow and text-color.
